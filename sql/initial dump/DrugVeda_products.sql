However, most prominently, it is a health supplement required for building and maintaining healthy bones and teeth. Our bones are calcium reservoirs of our body and get continuously used for performing various body functions. Calcium is very important for maintaining the balance between breaking down and building up of bones, especially in certain conditions like arthritis where the bone destruction exceeds the bone formation. It also supports flexible movements and mobility and reduces stiffness.\nVitamin D3: It plays a very crucial role in protecting your bones by helping your body absorb calcium and by supporting your muscles. It enhances the absorption of calcium and phosphorous from the intestine, which is critical for the strength of bone and teeth. If you don’t get enough vitamin D, you are more likely to experience fractures, muscle pain, weakness. It reduces the risk of osteoporosis, a condition of weak bones and due to its role in immune modulation, it helps relieve pain associated with arthritis.\nZinc: Zinc is an essential mineral involved in numerous aspects of cellular function and metabolic activities. Zinc supports normal growth and development, supports immune function, wound healing and is essentially required for the maintenance of healthy bones, joints and teeth. It stimulates bone formation and inhibits bone resorption, thereby increasing bone mass. It has preventive effects on bone loss induced in various conditions like arthritis.\nMagnesium: It is an essential mineral that regulates diverse biochemical reactions in the body like energy production, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control and blood pressure. Magnesium is required for the structural development of bone and is involved in bone formation and influences the activities of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone crucial for bone function. It has anti-inflammatory actions which help relieve pain and discomfort in arthritis and supports antioxidant action, thus protects joints and bones from oxidative damage. It improves flexibility and mobility of joints.\nCissus Quadrangularis: It is also known as “Bone Setter”. It has antioxidant, bone healing, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. It helps to increase the healing process of bones. It is very useful in conditions like osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is also known to promote levels of calcium and phosphorus that are essential for healthy bones.

However, most prominently, it is a health supplement required for building and maintaining healthy bones and teeth. Our bones are calcium reservoirs of our body and get continuously used for performing various body functions. Calcium is very important for maintaining the balance between breaking down and building up of bones, especially in certain conditions like arthritis where the bone destruction exceeds the bone formation. It also supports flexible movements and mobility and reduces stiffness.\nVitamin D3: It plays a very crucial role in protecting your bones by helping your body absorb calcium and by supporting your muscles. It enhances the absorption of calcium and phosphorous from the intestine, which is critical for the strength of bone and teeth. If you don’t get enough vitamin D, you are more likely to experience fractures, muscle pain, weakness. It reduces the risk of osteoporosis, a condition of weak bones and due to its role in immune modulation, it helps relieve pain associated with arthritis.\nZinc: Zinc is an essential mineral involved in numerous aspects of cellular function and metabolic activities. Zinc supports normal growth and development, supports immune function, wound healing and is essentially required for the maintenance of healthy bones, joints and teeth. It stimulates bone formation and inhibits bone resorption, thereby increasing bone mass. It has preventive effects on bone loss induced in various conditions like arthritis.\nMagnesium: It is an essential mineral that regulates diverse biochemical reactions in the body like energy production, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control and blood pressure. Magnesium is required for the structural development of bone and is involved in bone formation and influences the activities of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone crucial for bone function. It has anti-inflammatory actions which help relieve pain and discomfort in arthritis and supports antioxidant action, thus protects joints and bones from oxidative damage. It improves flexibility and mobility of joints.\nCissus Quadrangularis: It is also known as “Bone Setter”. It has antioxidant, bone healing, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. It helps to increase the healing process of bones. It is very useful in conditions like osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

It also supports flexible movements and mobility and reduces stiffness.\nVitamin D3: It plays a very crucial role in protecting your bones by helping your body absorb calcium and by supporting your muscles. It enhances the absorption of calcium and phosphorous from the intestine, which is critical for the strength of bone and teeth. If you don’t get enough vitamin D, you are more likely to experience fractures, muscle pain, weakness. It reduces the risk of osteoporosis, a condition of weak bones and due to its role in immune modulation, it helps relieve pain associated with arthritis.\nZinc: Zinc is an essential mineral involved in numerous aspects of cellular function and metabolic activities. Zinc supports normal growth and development, supports immune function, wound healing and is essentially required for the maintenance of healthy bones, joints and teeth. It stimulates bone formation and inhibits bone resorption, thereby increasing bone mass. It has preventive effects on bone loss induced in various conditions like arthritis.\nMagnesium: It is an essential mineral that regulates diverse biochemical reactions in the body like energy production, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control and blood pressure. Magnesium is required for the structural development of bone and is involved in bone formation and influences the activities of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone crucial for bone function. It has anti-inflammatory actions which help relieve pain and discomfort in arthritis and supports antioxidant action, thus protecting joints and bones from oxidative damage. It improves the flexibility and mobility of joints.\nCissus Quadrangularis: It is also known as “Bone Setter”. It has antioxidant, bone healing, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.

However, most prominently, it is required for building and maintaining healthy bones and teeth. Our bones are calcium reservoirs of our body and get continuously used for performing various body functions. Calcium is very important for maintaining the balance between breaking down and building up bones, especially in certain conditions like arthritis where bone destruction exceeds bone formation. It also supports flexible movements and mobility and reduces stiffness.\nVitamin D3: It plays a very crucial role in protecting your bones by helping your body absorb calcium and by supporting your muscles. It enhances the absorption of calcium and phosphorous from the intestine, which is critical for the strength of bone and teeth. If you don’t get enough vitamin D, you are more likely to experience fractures, muscle pain, weakness. It reduces the risk of osteoporosis, a condition of weak bones and due to its role in immune modulation, it helps relieve pain associated with arthritis.\nZinc: Zinc is an essential mineral involved in numerous aspects of cellular function and metabolic activities. Zinc supports normal growth and development, supports immune function, wound healing and is essentially required for the maintenance of healthy bones, joints and teeth. It stimulates bone formation and inhibits bone resorption, thereby increasing bone mass. It has preventive effects on bone loss induced in various conditions like arthritis.\nMagnesium: It is an essential mineral that regulates diverse biochemical reactions in the body like energy production, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control and blood pressure. Magnesium is required for the structural development of bone and is involved in bone formation and influences the activities of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone crucial for bone function. It has anti-inflammatory actions which help relieve pain and discomfort in arthritis and supports antioxidant action, thus protecting joints and bones from oxidative damage. It improves the flexibility and mobility of joints.\nCissus Quadrangularis: It is also known as “Bone Setter”. It has antioxidant, bone healing, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. It helps to increase the healing process of bones. It is very useful in conditions like osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is also known to promote levels of calcium and phosphorus that are essential for healthy bones. It influences the activity of osteoblast cells involved in bone formation and repair.\nHow to take this supplement:\nConsume this tablet twice a day with lukewarm water/milk or as directed by a physician\nIt should be taken after food\nDo not take this supplement more than the recommended daily dose\nVitamin and mineral supplements are intended to supplement the diets of some people and should not be a substitute for a well-balanced, varied diet and a healthy lifestyle\nStorage conditions: Store at room temperature (25-30°C).
