When the exposed dentine comes in contact with hot, cold, sweet or sour food and drinks, it can trigger a sharp short sensation called tooth sensitivity.\n\nSensodyne Fresh Gel is a daily fluoride toothpaste that helps protect against tooth sensitivity, while still providing the benefits of a regular paste like strong teeth and health gums. It also has a cool refreshing taste that leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean. With twice daily brushing, you can enjoy your favorite foods and drinks without the worry of sensitive teeth. Sensodyne Fresh Gel tooth paste is available in four packs - 75 gm, 150 gm, 450 gm (150 gm * 3) and 450 gm (150 gm - Buy 2 Get 1 free) combo pack.

Honey has sugar in the form of fructose & glucose collected by bees from flowering plants like eucalyptus and litchi. However, sugar (sucrose) sourced from C4 plants like cane which is cheap and easily available, can be broken into fructose & glucose through a simple heating process. This is then added to pure honey to reduce its cost. The C4 sugar in honey is limited to a maximum of 7% (as per standard recommended by Codex Alimentarius Commission Guidelines). When C4 sugar is above this level, the international laboratories consider it as a sure sign of added sugar from an external source in honey.\nZandu Pure honey is known to have 0% added sugar, no added C3/C4 /corn or cane syrup/sugar or rice syrup. All the batches of produced Zandu Pure honey go through a sugar test, the reports of which are published on www.zandupurehoney.com/purity-test.",

          "description": "LivEasy Wellness Calcium D3 Capsules contain calcium, vitamin D3, magnesium and zinc which are crucial for strong bones, joints, muscles & teeth. It supports bones formation, repair and healing. Vitamin D3 improves calcium absorption, thus supports healthy bones and joints.\nThis is a non-vegetarian product.\nKey benefits:\nHelps to build strong bones and dental health\nPromotes joint ease and comfort in arthritis\nPromotes formation of bones & delays resorption\nSupports the body\u2019s bone repair and healing processes\nImproves the immune system and inflammatory response\nMaintains healthy levels of vitamin D and minerals\nPrevents bones and teeth from oxidative damages\nHelps to relieve pain and discomfort in arthritis\nIngredients and Benefits:\nCalcium: It is the most profuse mineral in the body which is essential for critical metabolic functions like nerve transmission, muscle function, cellular signalling and hormone secretion. However, most prominently, it is a health supplement required for building and maintaining healthy bones and teeth. Our bones are calcium reservoirs of our body and get continuously used for performing various body functions. Calcium is very important for maintaining the balance between breaking down and building up of bones, especially in certain conditions like arthritis where the bone destruction exceeds the bone formation. It also supports flexible movements and mobility and reduces stiffness.\nVitamin D3: It plays a very crucial role in protecting your bones by helping your body absorb calcium and by supporting your muscles. It enhances the absorption of calcium and phosphorous from the intestine, which is critical for the strength of bone and teeth. If you don\u2019t get enough vitamin D, you are more likely to experience fractures, muscle pain, weakness. It reduces the risk of osteoporosis, a condition of weak bones and due to its role in immune modulation, it helps relieve pain associated with arthritis.\nZinc: Zinc is an essential mineral involved in numerous aspects of cellular function and metabolic activities. Zinc supports normal growth and development, supports immune function, wound healing and is essentially required for the maintenance of healthy bones, joints and teeth. It stimulates bone formation and inhibits bone resorption, thereby increasing bone mass. It has preventive effects on bone loss induced in various conditions like arthritis.\nMagnesium: It is an essential mineral that regulates diverse biochemical reactions in the body like energy production, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control and blood pressure. Magnesium is required for the structural development of bone and is involved in bone formation and influences the activities of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone crucial for bone function. It has anti-inflammatory actions which help relieve pain and discomfort in arthritis and supports antioxidant action, thus protects joints and bones from oxidative damage. It improves flexibility and mobility of joints.\nCissus Quadrangularis: It is also known as \u201cBone Setter\u201d. It has antioxidant, bone healing, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. It helps to increase the healing process of bones. It is very useful in conditions like osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is also known to promote levels of calcium and phosphorus that are essential for healthy bones. It influences the activity of osteoblast cells involved in bone formation and repair.\nHow to take this supplement:\nConsume this capsule twice a day with lukewarm water/milk or as directed by a physician\nIt should be taken after food\nDo not take this supplement more than the recommended daily dose\nVitamin and mineral supplements are intended to supplement the diets of some people and should not be a substitute for a well-balanced, varied diet and a healthy lifestyle\nStorage conditions: Store at room temperature (25-30\u00b0C).

It supports bones formation, repair and healing. Vitamin D3 improves calcium absorption, thus supports healthy bones and joints.\nThis is a non-vegetarian product.\nKey benefits:\nHelps to build strong bones and dental health\nPromotes joint ease and comfort in arthritis\nPromotes formation of bones & delays resorption\nSupports the body\u2019s bone repair and healing processes\nImproves the immune system and inflammatory response\nMaintains healthy levels of vitamin D and minerals\nPrevents bones and teeth from oxidative damages\nHelps to relieve pain and discomfort in arthritis\nIngredients and Benefits:\nCalcium: It is the most profuse mineral in the body which is essential for critical metabolic functions like nerve transmission, muscle function, cellular signalling and hormone secretion. However, most prominently, it is a health supplement required for building and maintaining healthy bones and teeth. Our bones are calcium reservoirs of our body and get continuously used for performing various body functions. Calcium is very important for maintaining the balance between breaking down and building up of bones, especially in certain conditions like arthritis where the bone destruction exceeds the bone formation. It also supports flexible movements and mobility and reduces stiffness.\nVitamin D3: It plays a very crucial role in protecting your bones by helping your body absorb calcium and by supporting your muscles. It enhances the absorption of calcium and phosphorous from the intestine, which is critical for the strength of bone and teeth. If you don\u2019t get enough vitamin D, you are more likely to experience fractures, muscle pain, weakness. It reduces the risk of osteoporosis, a condition of weak bones and due to its role in immune modulation, it helps relieve pain associated with arthritis.\nZinc: Zinc is an essential mineral involved in numerous aspects of cellular function and metabolic activities. Zinc supports normal growth and development, supports immune function, wound healing and is essentially required for the maintenance of healthy bones, joints and teeth. It stimulates bone formation and inhibits bone resorption, thereby increasing bone mass. It has preventive effects on bone loss induced in various conditions like arthritis.\nMagnesium: It is an essential mineral that regulates diverse biochemical reactions in the body like energy production, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control and blood pressure. Magnesium is required for the structural development of bone and is involved in bone formation and influences the activities of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone crucial for bone function. It has anti-inflammatory actions which help relieve pain and discomfort in arthritis and supports antioxidant action, thus protects joints and bones from oxidative damage. It improves flexibility and mobility of joints.\nCissus Quadrangularis: It is also known as \u201cBone Setter\u201d. It has antioxidant, bone healing, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. It helps to increase the healing process of bones. It is very useful in conditions like osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is also known to promote levels of calcium and phosphorus that are essential for healthy bones. It influences the activity of osteoblast cells involved in bone formation and repair.\nHow to take this supplement:\nConsume this capsule twice a day with lukewarm water/milk or as directed by a physician\nIt should be taken after food\nDo not take this supplement more than the recommended daily dose\nVitamin and mineral supplements are intended to supplement the diets of some people and should not be a substitute for a well-balanced, varied diet and a healthy lifestyle\nStorage conditions: Store at room temperature (25-30\u00b0C).

Take the multivitamins as per your health needs only.\nQ.9 Is it safe to take multivitamins on an empty stomach?\nAns) Multivitamins typically contain a combination of fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins.

          "description": "PharmEasy Calcium, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 & Zinc tablets contain calcium, vitamin D3, magnesium and zinc which are crucial for strong bones, joints, muscles & teeth. It is a health supplement that supports bone formation, repair and healing. Vitamin D3 improves calcium absorption, thus supporting healthy bones and joints.\nThis is a non-vegetarian product.\nKey benefits:\nHelps to build strong bones and dental health\nPromotes joint ease and comfort in arthritis\nPromotes formation of bones & delays resorption\nSupports the body\u2019s bone repair and healing processes\nImproves the immune system and inflammatory response\nMaintains healthy levels of Vitamin D and minerals\nPrevents bones and teeth from oxidative damages\nHelps to relieve pain and discomfort in arthritis\nIngredients and Benefits:\nCalcium: It is the most profuse mineral in the body which is essential for critical metabolic functions like nerve transmission, muscle function, cellular signalling and hormone secretion. However, most prominently, it is required for building and maintaining healthy bones and teeth. Our bones are calcium reservoirs of our body and get continuously used for performing various body functions. Calcium is very important for maintaining the balance between breaking down and building up bones, especially in certain conditions like arthritis where bone destruction exceeds bone formation. It also supports flexible movements and mobility and reduces stiffness.\nVitamin D3: It plays a very crucial role in protecting your bones by helping your body absorb calcium and by supporting your muscles. It enhances the absorption of calcium and phosphorous from the intestine, which is critical for the strength of bone and teeth. If you don\u2019t get enough vitamin D, you are more likely to experience fractures, muscle pain, weakness. It reduces the risk of osteoporosis, a condition of weak bones and due to its role in immune modulation, it helps relieve pain associated with arthritis.\nZinc: Zinc is an essential mineral involved in numerous aspects of cellular function and metabolic activities. Zinc supports normal growth and development, supports immune function, wound healing and is essentially required for the maintenance of healthy bones, joints and teeth. It stimulates bone formation and inhibits bone resorption, thereby increasing bone mass. It has preventive effects on bone loss induced in various conditions like arthritis.\nMagnesium: It is an essential mineral that regulates diverse biochemical reactions in the body like energy production, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control and blood pressure. Magnesium is required for the structural development of bone and is involved in bone formation and influences the activities of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone crucial for bone function. It has anti-inflammatory actions which help relieve pain and discomfort in arthritis and supports antioxidant action, thus protecting joints and bones from oxidative damage. It improves the flexibility and mobility of joints.\nCissus Quadrangularis: It is also known as \u201cBone Setter\u201d. It has antioxidant, bone healing, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. It helps to increase the healing process of bones. It is very useful in conditions like osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is also known to promote levels of calcium and phosphorus that are essential for healthy bones. It influences the activity of osteoblast cells involved in bone formation and repair.\nHow to take this supplement:\nConsume this tablet twice a day with lukewarm water/milk or as directed by a physician\nIt should be taken after food\nDo not take this supplement more than the recommended daily dose\nVitamin and mineral supplements are intended to supplement the diets of some people and should not be a substitute for a well-balanced, varied diet and a healthy lifestyle\nStorage conditions: Store at room temperature (25-30\u00b0C).

          "description": "PharmEasy Calcium, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 & Zinc tablets contain calcium, vitamin D3, magnesium and zinc which are crucial for strong bones, joints, muscles & teeth. It is a health supplement that supports bone formation, repair and healing. Vitamin D3 improves calcium absorption, thus supporting healthy bones and joints.\nThis is a non-vegetarian product.\nKey benefits:\nHelps to build strong bones and dental health\nPromotes joint ease and comfort in arthritis\nPromotes formation of bones & delays resorption\nSupports the body\u2019s bone repair and healing processes\nImproves the immune system and inflammatory response\nMaintains healthy levels of Vitamin D and minerals\nPrevents bones and teeth from oxidative damages\nHelps to relieve pain and discomfort in arthritis\nIngredients and Benefits:\nCalcium: It is the most profuse mineral in the body which is essential for critical metabolic functions like nerve transmission, muscle function, cellular signalling and hormone secretion. However, most prominently, it is required for building and maintaining healthy bones and teeth. Our bones are calcium reservoirs of our body and get continuously used for performing various body functions. Calcium is very important for maintaining the balance between breaking down and building up bones, especially in certain conditions like arthritis where bone destruction exceeds bone formation. It also supports flexible movements and mobility and reduces stiffness.\nVitamin D3: It plays a very crucial role in protecting your bones by helping your body absorb calcium and by supporting your muscles. It enhances the absorption of calcium and phosphorous from the intestine, which is critical for the strength of bone and teeth. If you don\u2019t get enough vitamin D, you are more likely to experience fractures, muscle pain, weakness. It reduces the risk of osteoporosis, a condition of weak bones and due to its role in immune modulation, it helps relieve pain associated with arthritis.\nZinc: Zinc is an essential mineral involved in numerous aspects of cellular function and metabolic activities. Zinc supports normal growth and development, supports immune function, wound healing and is essentially required for the maintenance of healthy bones, joints and teeth. It stimulates bone formation and inhibits bone resorption, thereby increasing bone mass. It has preventive effects on bone loss induced in various conditions like arthritis.\nMagnesium: It is an essential mineral that regulates diverse biochemical reactions in the body like energy production, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control and blood pressure. Magnesium is required for the structural development of bone and is involved in bone formation and influences the activities of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone crucial for bone function. It has anti-inflammatory actions which help relieve pain and discomfort in arthritis and supports antioxidant action, thus protecting joints and bones from oxidative damage. It improves the flexibility and mobility of joints.\nCissus Quadrangularis: It is also known as \u201cBone Setter\u201d. It has antioxidant, bone healing, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.
