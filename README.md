# DrugVeda

The recent boom in the pharmaceutical industry due to an increase in public health awareness and self-hygiene has motivated us to work on an e-commerce pharmacy store DrugVeda, which will allow its users to order their prescriptions and book regular health checks from their fingertips. The goal is to streamline the user experience and improve access to healthcare services for the general populace.
